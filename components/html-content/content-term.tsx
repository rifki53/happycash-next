                smaller loan values, making the process equitable for borrowers.
                For example, if a borrower has a loan amount of Php 500.00, the
                processing fee will be the original interest rather than the
                standard Php 220.00. Consequently, the total amount payable by
                the borrower would be Php 575.00, which includes the principal
